The structural metadata will include:</p> <ol> <li>Hierarchy: A top-level structure that organizes the app's content and features into categories and subcategories. For example, main sections like Memory Exercises, Image Recognition, Caregiver Support, and Resources.</li> <li>Document position: The location of specific content elements within the app, such as articles, videos, or cognitive exercises.</li> <li>Relationships between content elements: This includes linking related content, such as connecting a specific cognitive exercise to relevant educational materials or resources.</li> <li>Navigation: A consistent navigation system that allows users to move between sections and content elements with ease. This may include menus, breadcrumbs, or other navigation aids.</li> </ol> <p>Descriptive Metadata: Descriptive metadata refers to information about the content itself, such as titles, descriptions, tags, or categories. Descriptive metadata helps users find and understand the content they are looking for and supports search functionality within the app. For your app, the descriptive metadata could include:</p> <ol> <li>Titles: Clear and informative titles for each content element, such as articles, videos, or cognitive exercises.</li> <li>Descriptions: Brief descriptions that provide an overview of the content and its purpose.</li> <li>Tags or keywords: Relevant tags or keywords associated</li> </ol> <p>with each content element to support search functionality and content discovery. 4. Categories: Assigning content elements to appropriate categories based on their subject matter or purpose, which also helps with structuring the app and improving navigation.</p> <p>By implementing a robust content management system, ensuring legal compliance, and utilizing effective metadata, the app can efficiently organize, create, and deliver content to enhance the user experience and provide valuable support for caregivers and individuals with memory loss problems.</p>"},{"location":"evaluation/","title":"DESIGN EVALUATION","text":"<p>Design Evaluation Before Cognitive Walkthrough.
