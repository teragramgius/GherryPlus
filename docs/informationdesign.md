Events section

# INTERACTION CARETAKER-ELDERLY
Each caretaker can switch between the profiles of all his elderly

# INTERACTION CARETAKER-CARETAKER
Each caretaker, beside the main interface showing the actions performed by the elderly person, also has a caregiver chat where they can be supported and ask advice.

# NAVIGATION BETWEEN THE SECTIONS
When you click on a section you can perform different activities...
There is a menu on top where you can see the type of profile (caregiver, elderly person). And then an icon with their profile picture. 
The interaction difference between elderly people and caregivers, is that a caregiver can visualize as a mirror all the activities that the eledely performs, as well as a geo-localized chat to interact with other professionals.
# BLUEPRINTS
detailed structure of the system. When providing blueprints we distinguish between pages (full-screen views), components
(fragments of a larger page, possibly menus or widgets) and navigation (points of
interaction that lead to other pages or sections).

# WIREFRAMES
For each subsection (profile page, activities, community chat)
The more we go in depth the better it is
