*The position that you allocate to a stakeholder on the grid shows you the actions to take with them:*

- **High power**, highly interested people: Fully engage these people, and make the greatest efforts to satisfy them.
- **High power**, less interested people: Keep these stakeholders satisfied, but not so much that they become bored with your message.
- **Low power**, highly interested people: Adequately inform these people, and talk to them to ensure that no major issues arise. People in this category can often be very helpful with the details of your project in a supportive role.
- **Low power**, less interested people: Again, monitor these people, but don’t bore them with excessive communication.


## 1: AIMA, Via Altura 3 - since 1985
### Open on Monday, 9am-4pm
**[WHAT]**
*slogan: "Non dimenticare chi dimentica"* - ("Do not forget who forgets")
The goal is to support those close to the patient, inform them and, above all, "train" them so that they can combine love for the affected person with the necessary competence to deal with all aspects of the disease.
AIMA therefore works on different levels: **it works internally**, coordinating the association's policies and campaigns and supporting the activities of the local offices. **Externally**, AIMA has the task of influencing cultural policies to raise awareness of public opinion, through a widespread work of information and promotion on topics of interest; it has the task of influencing welfare policies, with careful monitoring of national and regional legislative activity, also in alliance with other large associations for the protection of rights. And it has the task of promoting biochemical research for an increasingly in-depth knowledge of the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of dementia, and of carrying out epidemiological and economic research itself aimed at an ever more in-depth knowledge of the disease.


**[EVENTS&others]**
1. Banca della Memoria = you can send audiovisual material to remember our dearest people who got no memory anymore
2. In addition, three surveys on the costs of the disease were presented (the only Italian ones) elaborated with Censis (1999-2006-2016); set up a consultancy service for degree or diploma theses; worked on the environment, on psychological support for family members, on rehabilitation and on knowledge of pharmacological therapies, on day care centers and on new techniques for limiting restraint, on communication (two commercials were produced, directed by Dario Argento and Giuseppe Tornatore and a documentary "Vittorio, Capitan Pistone and all the others..." directed by Mara Consoli), on legislation (presenting questions and amendments, collecting signatures and petitions, and also leading a hunger strike for uniformity of care on the national territory); work was also done on health planning, again and again with the same spirit of service as the foundation. AIMA is currently part of the coordination group of the Interceptor Project (study project that has the objective of identifying the "marker" or "set of markers" capable of accurately predicting the conversion of the diagnosis of mild cognitive decline - Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI - in Alzheimer's disease, after 3 years of follow-up, in order to identify early those patients who will appropriately benefit from new therapies currently being tested.Interceptor is funded by AIFA and the Ministry of Health) . He is part of the Ministry of Health, of the National Dementia Table (which elaborated the National Dementia Plan) and of the Ethics sub-table.
