## ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH AND SPECIFIC DOMAIN
## P.E.S.T.E.L. ANALYSIS
In the context of our ethnographic research in the specific domain, we conducted a PESTEL analysis to examine the macro-environmental factors that can impact the identified target profiles. Here's a breakdown of these factors for each profile:

# Elderly individuals with memory loss problems:

Political: Government policies and regulations related to healthcare services, elder care, and social security benefits.
Economic: Economic stability, income, and affordability of healthcare services and assisted living facilities.
Sociocultural: Social attitudes towards aging and dementia, awareness and understanding of memory loss conditions, and the role of the family in caregiving.
Technological: The availability and adoption of technology for healthcare, communication, and assisted living.
Environmental: The impact of environmental factors on cognitive health, such as air pollution and noise levels.
Legal: Legal protections and rights for elderly individuals, such as anti-discrimination laws and the right to accessible healthcare.

# Family caregivers:

- Political: Government policies and regulations on caregiving, including tax credits, subsidies, and other support mechanisms for family caregivers.
- Economic: Economic stability and employment opportunities for caregivers, and the financial burden of caregiving.
- Sociocultural: Societal attitudes towards caregiving, and the balance between work, caregiving, and personal life.
- Technological: The availability and adoption of technology for communication, healthcare management, and caregiving support.
- Environmental: The impact of environmental factors on caregiver stress and well-being, such as living conditions and access to green spaces.

Environmental: The impact of environmental factors on healthcare professionals' work environment, stress levels, and well-being.
Legal: Legal protections and rights for healthcare professionals, such as malpractice laws, licensing requirements, and professional ethics guidelines.
By considering the PESTEL analysis for each profile, we gain a deeper understanding of the external factors that influence their experiences and needs. This understanding will aid in designing an application that is responsive to these factors, effectively addressing the challenges faced by both caregivers and elderly individuals with memory loss problems.
