# INTRODUCTION

The aim of our application is to directly assist caregivers and indirectly elderly people suffering from memory loss. It's designed to streamline the tasks of caregivers and also to help improve the memory and social connections of elderly users.

The application has four main components:

Personal Profiles: Users (both caregivers and elderly individuals) can create, read, update, and delete their personal profiles. These profiles might include relevant information about their medical history, current medications, emergency contacts, and more.

Reminders: Caregivers can create, read, update, and delete reminders. These reminders could be for medication, appointments, daily activities, or anything else that requires regular prompting.

Memory Exercises: A feature accessible by both caregivers and elderly users, designed to help stimulate memory and cognitive function. Users can read and interact with these exercises. The exercises could include puzzles, quizzes, and games designed to support memory retention and cognitive health.

Social Connections: Both caregivers and elderly users can create, read, update, and delete social connections. This feature encourages social interaction, possibly reducing feelings of isolation among elderly individuals.

Resource Library: A section accessible to caregivers for reading and gathering information and resources about caring for individuals with memory loss. It might include guides, articles, and links to helpful external resources.

The application is designed with a user-centric approach, taking into account the different abilities and needs of the user profiles, which are:

Elderly individuals with memory loss problems
Family caregivers
Professional caregivers
Healthcare professionals

Considerations are made for each user profile's concentration, motivation, physical and visual abilities, linguistic competency, domain competency, and technical competency, ensuring that the user interface and functionalities are tailored to their unique needs and capabilities.

The development of the application is guided by a PESTEL analysis, ensuring that political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and legal factors are considered in its design and implementation.

The app aims to ease the struggle of caregiving, improve the quality of life for those with memory loss, and foster stronger social connections among users.
