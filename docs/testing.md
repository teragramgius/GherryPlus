The sum of the points for each app provides an indication of the system's usability according to the specific user.


# RESULTS ANALYSIS

The results of the SUS assessment and usability testing provide valuable insights into the participants' experiences and perceptions of the app. Let's analyze the findings for each group of participants:

### 1. Caregiver A, Patrizia:
   - Patrizia found the system moderately complex but relatively easy to use.
   - She felt confident using the system but needed some assistance to set a medication reminder.
   - Patrizia had a positive overall experience with the app and expressed interest in using it frequently.
   - However, learnability was a challenge for her, indicating that some improvements in user onboarding and training may be necessary.

### 2. Caregiver B, Laura:
   - Laura found the system easy to use, efficient, and enjoyable.
   - She successfully completed all the tasks without assistance and had a positive overall experience.
   - Laura's responses indicate high learnability and satisfaction with the app's features.
   - These findings validate the usability of the app for caregivers like Laura.

### 3. Elder A, Maria:
   - Maria, who has mild dementia, faced challenges in providing precise responses.
   - She experienced difficulty in using the navigation feature, which led to a failure in the task.
   - Maria expressed the need for reminders and assistance in recognizing people and places.
   - These findings highlight the importance of simplicity and clarity in the app's design for users with memory problems.

### 4. Elder B, Anna:
   - Anna, who has Alzheimer's, struggled to give precise responses and expressed strong disagreement with the usability of the system.
   - She found the system complex, difficult to use, and cumbersome.
   - Anna felt that she needed significant support from a technical person and had low confidence in using the system.
   - These findings emphasize the need for a simplified and intuitive interface tailored to the specific needs and limitations of individuals with advanced Alzheimer's.

# URGENCY CURVES OF ERRORS

The urgency curves of errors help prioritize and address critical issues based on their impact and urgency. Here's an example of the urgency curves of errors for the app:

Critical Errors:

Failure to set a medication reminder for a specific time (Task 1): This is critical as it directly affects the well-being and safety of the care recipient. Immediate attention is needed to ensure reliable medication management.
High-Priority Errors:

Difficulty using the navigation feature to find a specific location (Task 3): This error is significant as it affects the user's ability to navigate and find their way, which can lead to disorientation and potential safety concerns.
Medium-Priority Errors:

Success with assistance in using the facial recognition feature to identify a family member (Task 4): While the task was completed with assistance, it indicates a need for improvement in the system's accuracy and ease of use.

# TESTING CONCLUSIONS

The testing results validate the demographic assumptions to some extent. Caregivers, such as Patrizia and Laura, find value in the app and appreciate its features, indicating a validation of the assumption that caregivers would benefit from a supportive app. However, the challenges faced by individuals with memory problems, like Maria and Anna, highlight the importance of considering their specific needs and limitations to ensure the app is truly accessible and beneficial for them.

# Main Use Cases Emerged

Based on the testing results, the main use cases that have emerged include:
- Navigation and location assistance
- Facial recognition for identifying family members


# OBSTACLES

During the testing and evaluation of the app, several obstacles were identified that may impact its effectiveness and adoption. These obstacles include:

1. Limited Familiarity with Technology: Some participants, particularly the elderly and individuals with memory problems, expressed difficulties in using technology. Their limited familiarity and comfort with digital devices and applications pose a challenge in effectively utilizing the app's features.

2. Cognitive Limitations: Participants with dementia or Alzheimer's faced difficulties in providing precise responses, understanding complex tasks, and retaining information. Their cognitive limitations hindered their ability to fully engage with the app and provide accurate feedback.

3. Navigation and Orientation Issues: Users, especially those with memory problems, faced challenges in navigating the app and finding their way within the interface. The navigation feature was not intuitive enough to guide users effectively, resulting in frustration and confusion.

4. Accuracy of Facial Recognition: The facial recognition feature, while helpful, faced accuracy issues, particularly in identifying family members or familiar faces. Inaccurate recognition can lead to confusion and potential distress for users.

5. Learning Curve: Users mentioned a steep learning curve in understanding and utilizing the app's functionalities. The complexity of certain tasks and the need to learn new processes and features presented a challenge, especially for caregivers who may already have demanding responsibilities.

6. Technical Support: Some participants expressed concerns about the availability of technical support. They felt that having access to knowledgeable individuals who can assist them in using the app would be beneficial, particularly for those with limited technical skills.

Addressing these obstacles will be crucial for improving the app's usability and ensuring it effectively meets the needs of its target users. Simplifying the user interface, enhancing navigational aids, improving accuracy in recognition features, providing user-friendly tutorials, and offering accessible technical support are potential strategies to overcome these obstacles.
