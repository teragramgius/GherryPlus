# TESTING THE INTERFACE
# SUS ASSESSMENT
We measure success (whether the user succeeds or not, with or without help), efficiency
(whether the user makes mistakes or backtracks), learnability (whether the user displays
familiarity with the system in later tasks) and general enjoyment of the product. Furthermore,
we integrate the test with a system usability scale (SUS) assessment.

Explain the CONTEXT of testing, what is being tested?
Give TASKS to perform within the interface and evaluate them in a table with SUCCESS (possible outputs: Success with
assistance, success, failure), EFFICIENCY (very high, High: easy backtracking, Low), LEARNABILITY, ENJOYMENT.



SECOND TABLE: statements (I think that I would like to use this
system frequently, I found the system unnecessarily
complex. I thought the system was easy to use. I think that I would need the support of a technical person
to be able to use this system. I found the various functions in this
system were well integrated. I thought there was too much
inconsistency in this system. I would imagine that most people
would learn to use this
system very quickly. I found the system very cumbersome
to use. I felt very confident using the system. I needed to learn a lot of things
before I could get going
with this system.
+ parallel view of the chosen benchmark app and our app, users must assign points from 10 to 1 to how much the statements appear true to them. Translate the questions in italian
In this way it is possible to compare our application to the already present one. The sum of the questions will give the usability of the system according to that specific user.
